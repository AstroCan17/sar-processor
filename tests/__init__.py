In this folder, you will find several tests:
* unit tests that runs atomic tests for processing unit classes.
  These tests can be found in the 'ut' folder.
* integration tests that runs run of processor classes and tests whether the
  run suceeds or fails.
  These tests can be found in the 'it' folder.

We use pytest to run tests. We use pytest's decorator to choose the test level
e.g. either a unit test or an integration test.
A test is follow some rules:
* initialize the input of your method.
* run the method you want to test and save the output.
* create the expected output.
* realize the comparison between the expected output and the output from the
  tested method.
