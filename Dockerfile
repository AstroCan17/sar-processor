# This Dockerfile relies on Docker's multi-stage build feature:
# https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/
#
# Currently, there is a known problem with pre-stages not being cached.
# See this link for more information: https://snyk.io/blog/best-practices-containerizing-python-docker/
# and the section "Known issues with multi-stage builds for containerized Python applications".
#
# Thus, please run the following commands to build the image:
#
#   export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
#   export BUILDKIT_PROGRESS=plain
#   docker build -t cpm:multi-stage --cache-from cpm:multi-stage --build-arg BUILDKIT_INLINE_CACHE=1 .

# Build stage
FROM python:3.11.7-bullseye as build

# Define the CPM package registry to be able to install the CPM package.
#
# Please use read-only tokens to access the GitLab package registries.

# Install sar_processor from source.
#
# This solution has been chosen to allow building an image for the latest state
# of the "main" branch without previously uploading a fixed version of the
# corresponding Python package into the package registry,
# thus simplifying the testing of the "main" branch.
COPY . /opt/sar_processor
# Skip the "bin not on PATH" warning: This is only a build container.
RUN pip install --user --no-cache-dir --no-warn-script-location /opt/sar_processor[cluster-plugin]

# Final stage
#
# Use the EOPF Dask image as the base of the Dask runtime environment.
# The 'latest' tag is used by the template to test the current version.
# Moreover, the usage of the 'latest' tag causes a warning to be raised by
# the docker-linter CI job.
# However, user projects are encouraged to fix the version of the base image.
